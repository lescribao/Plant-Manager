# Plant-Manager

The concept of this full stack project started thanks to my work at a flower shop this past year, in which I was able to not only learn about plant names, but also their care.

With this applciation, users will be able to;

<h2> Discover page </h2>
Search and explore new plants through a database which will show a random plant of the month in season, search plants by name through the USDA Plants Database API (https://plantsdb.xyz), and if it's a plant they own, add it to their profile.

<h2> Profile </h2>
In their profile they will be able to see all of their owned plants, and mouse-over/click in order to see more details such as;
- Amount of water needed during the current season
- When did they get the plant
- Small description of the plant
- Special treatment, special things to take into consideration
- If the plant is toxic to any animals.

As well as see which plants they should water today, or if it's a plant-iversary. Both of those will also be displayed through notifications to remind the users to care for their plants.

All of which will be stored and managed in the database, which plants they own, watering cycles, date of "adoption" of the plant, and other user-specific details.

<h2> (optional) Plant Calendar </h2>
A calendar of the month showing special days, highlighting in different colors the day to water plants, give them fertilizer, etc.

<h2> (optional) Plant Identification </h2>
Through the (https://web.plant.id/) API I would like to experiment with it, integrate it into my service, and offer users the option to upload images of their plants to detect which plant it is, and if found, have the option to add it to their profile.
